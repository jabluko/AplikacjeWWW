COBOL is still widely used in applications … What is COBOL? - IBM COBOL was designed with optimal versatility in mind; its verbosity enables programmers to use a readable, easily maintainable programming language that can function across mainframe computers and operating systems. In fact, it was one of the first programming languages that the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standardized. Brush up your COBOL: Why is a 60 year old language suddenly in demand? Compared to common programming languages today, COBOL is different, and in some ways very limited: you can’t do dynamic memory allocation, you can’t easily access low-level features of the operating system or particular computer architecture. The most common forms of the language can’t use recursion. You’d never want to write a compiler in COBOL.

It was developed in the late 1950s for business applications and administrative systems. COBOL is known for its readability and easy-to-understand syntax that resembles natural English.
